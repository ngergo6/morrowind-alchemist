# Morrowind alchemy helper

## For anyone looking at this repository

I suggest not to copy any snippets of code from this project or use anything you see here as an example of how you should develop React applications.

When I made this project I just started to learn how to use React. This shows in many ways, from design decisions that aren't suited for React, to individual implementations that could have been done in a better ways.

## Requirements
- latest version of NodeJS
- the following npm modules installed globally: ```typescript```, ```typings```, ```webpack```

## To install (quick)
1. ```typings install``` to install the required typings
1. ```npm install``` to install dependencies from npm
1. ```webpack``` to bundle the app
1. ```npm start``` to run the app

The app will run on port 5000 by default.
